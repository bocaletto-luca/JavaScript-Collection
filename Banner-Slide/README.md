## Overview

The Responsive Banner Slider is a lightweight, modular slider application built with HTML5, JavaScript (ES6), and Bootstrap for responsiveness. This project features:

- **Automatic Slide Transition:** The slider automatically cycles through multiple banners at a configurable interval.
- **Manual Navigation:** Users can manually navigate using previous/next buttons or by clicking on dot indicators.
- **Responsive Design:** Built using Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across various device sizes.
- **Reusable Code:** The slider functionality is encapsulated in a reusable `BannerSlider` class.

## Files

- **banner.html**  
  The main HTML file that sets up the slider structure, loads Bootstrap and custom CSS, and links to the JavaScript file.

- **banner.js**  
  Contains the implementation of the `BannerSlider` class. It handles auto-sliding, manual navigation, and interaction with dot indicators.
